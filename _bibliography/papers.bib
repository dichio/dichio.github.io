  abstract = {We apply Direct Coupling Analysis (DCA) to a large dataset of SARS-CoV-2 genomes to infer the strongest epistatic coupling between different genes. Our analysis unveils significant interactions between the loci in the viral genes ORF3a and nsp2, nsp12, and nsp6, as well as between ORF8 and nsp4, and among the loci in the genes nsp2, nsp13, and nsp14.},

  abstract = {We address the problem of inferring fitness in an evolutionary dynamics from multiple snapshots of the genotype distribution in a population that is in a quasi-linkage equilibrium regime. We extend the current state-of-the-art methods and leverage a recently proposed technique that uses a Gaussian approximation for the probability distribution of the genome. The results are validated through in silico experiments.},

These models can be utilized to characterize the state of a network, distinguish between different states, and forecast future outcomes. We present a brief overview of the method, examine current applications in brain networks, and provide a critical discussion.}
