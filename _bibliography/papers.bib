  abstract = {We apply Direct Coupling Analysis (DCA) to a large dataset of SARS-CoV-2 genomes to infer the strongest epistatic coupling between different genes. Our analysis unveils significant interactions between the loci in the viral genes ORF3a and nsp2, nsp12, and nsp6, as well as between ORF8 and nsp4, and among the loci in the genes nsp2, nsp13, and nsp14.},
